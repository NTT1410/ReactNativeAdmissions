# ReactNativeAdmissions

## Set up

You can start by cloning this repository and using react-native-rename. In the current state of this project, it should give you no issues at all, just run the script, delete your node modules and reinstall them and you should be good to go.

Keep in mind that this library can cause trouble if you are renaming a project that uses Pods on the iOS side.

After that you should proceed as with any javascript project:

Go to your project's root folder and run npm install.
If you are using Xcode 12.5 or higher got to /ios and execute pod install --repo-update`

## Run
run npm start to start your application!
Run npm run ios or npm run android.
Press S to launch expo.
Press A to launch run on android Or scan the QR code to run on iOS.

Note: Please read the Setup environments section that is below in this file for more information about the execution scripts.
